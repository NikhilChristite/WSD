            <p>In elementary school, interactive read-alouds are commonly used to build various literacy skills, such as students’ listening comprehension, background knowledge, vocabulary, and understanding of language structures. Beyond their academic benefits, however, read-alouds can also serve as a support for developing social and emotional learning (SEL) skills. </p>

            <h2>How important is homework, and how much should parents help?</h2>
            <p>In recent years, homework has become a very hot topic. Many parents and educators have raised concerns about homework and questioned how effective it is in enhancing students’ learning. There are also concerns that students may be getting too much homework, which ultimately interferes with quality family time and opportunities for physical activity and play. Research suggests that these concerns may be valid. For example, one study reported that elementary school students, on average, are assigned three times the recommended amount of homework.</p>

        <h1><b>Six Ways to Find Your Courage During Challenging Times</b></h1>
        <p><b>Author: <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/profile/amy_eva    ">Amy L. Eva</a></b></p>

        <h2><b><i>Courage doesn’t have to look dramatic or fearless. Sometimes it looks more like quiet perseverance.</i></b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Early in my teaching career, I participated in a series of retreats led by the Center for Courage
             and Renewal, inspired by Palmer’s book The Courage to Teach. Palmer reminds us that our sense of
              self plays out in our work every day—and living with courage and integrity means finding balance
               and alignment between our inner and outer selves. In other words, our identities, values, and 
               beliefs inform the selves we bring to others.</p>
               <p>
               But how do we find the courage to stand up for our coworkers, students, neighbors, family and 
               friends, and ourselves amid exhausting and unprecedented challenges? The truth is, I’m not 
               particularly thrilled with the person I’ve been bringing to work lately. On some mornings, 
               I’m simply looking for the courage to get out of bed.If you are like me, there are days when 
               you feel emotionally weary, inept, and cynical—all characteristics of burnout. However, I’m finding
                that the science of courage offers a psychological lifeline, helping us to clarify what really 
                matters so that we can find a steadier, values-based resolve—and even inspire it in others. 
                I dove into the courage research with teachers in mind, but these tips are for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fortunately, courage comes in many forms. Although definitions range, researchers tend to agree that 
            it features three primary components: a risk, an intention, and a goal that may benefit others. 
            In a classic example, a student defends a peer who is being verbally assaulted by a bully, by 
            interrupting the bully and telling them to stop. This purposeful act may come at a cost—perhaps
             socially or physically. But courage doesn’t have to look dramatic or fearless. We express it in 
             both bold and quiet ways. In fact, “general courage,” the confident or seemingly brazen actions 
             perceived by others, differs from “personal courage,” those actions that are courageous in the 
             minds of the actors themselves. It all depends on how you view the challenge in front of you and 
             the fears associated with performing a particular behavior. In other words, these days, some of 
             us may need significant “personal courage” to get out of bed and face the day on behalf of those 
             students we value and care about.
        </p>
        <p><b>1. See yourself as courageous</b></p>
        <p>
            First, if we describe ourselves as “courageous,” we are more likely to act courageously. In other 
            words, if I tell myself that I’m a courageous person as I park in the school parking lot and walk 
            into my school, it may actually give me a psychological boost and inspire me to meet the day with 
            greater self-assurance.</p>
       <p>Alternatively, we can take time to note and label all the courageous actions we have already taken 
        in our lives. For example, when you consider how your childhood struggles inform your current relationships
         with coworkers or students, or how you made it through college as a single mom, or how you’ve learned to 
         cope with a chronic health issue, you may be more likely to experience positive emotions while reconnecting
          with personal values and beliefs that can inspire future courageous behaviors.</p>
            <p><b>2. Get comfortable with “mistakes”</b></p>
            <p>We can recognize and celebrate courage with others, but it can also be a very internal, day-to-day 
                experience. One of the most common ways we practice courage at work is in our pursuit of learning 
                and personal growth. Research tells us that fear of failure can negatively correlate with courage,
                 but what if it’s OK to make mistakes—and they are even welcomed learning tools?</p>
            <p>Studies indicate that students may benefit from making mistakes (and correcting them) rather than 
                avoiding them at all costs. And when researchers reviewed 38 studies of resilience in response to 
                failure, errors, or mistakes, they found that more resilient individuals had lower levels of 
                perfectionism and a more positive way of explaining past events: “I haven’t solved this long division 
                problem yet, but I’ll try another strategy next.”</p>


            <p><b>3. Keep trying</b></p>
            <p>Courage at work also requires perseverance. As our fears lessen, we are more likely to persist in 
                learning—to keep trying despite the obstacles ahead of us. And perseverance (or persistence), as 
                a character strength, can also be modeled, observed, and developed. In fact, when adults model 
                persistence in working toward a goal, infants as young as 15 months tend to mimic that behavior.</p>
            <p>As teachers, we have a lot of power to influence our students’ efforts by sharing our own vulnerabilities 
                while we read a challenging text, our own self-conscious emotions as we outline a timed essay, our stops
                 and starts while solving a word problem, and our commitment to keep going.

                And research suggests that teachers’ growth mindsets, or belief that intelligence grows and changes 
                with effort, can be linked to the development of students’ growth mindsets. This more positive,
                 flexible mindset can improve students’ performance at school, boost their well-being and social
                  competence, and even promote kind, helpful, and prosocial actions. All these benefits may bolster 
                  our capacity for courageous actions, too.</p>

            <p><b>4. Look for the heroesg</b></p>
            <p>Of course, if we are feeling apathetic, anxious, or fearful about stepping up and doing that next 
                best thing at school or in life, it can be helpful to draw inspiration from others—whether near or 
                far, real or fictional.

                According to research, the individuals we admire may represent some aspect of our ideal selves as 
                they demonstrate moral courage through difficult times and a desire to do good in the world. 
                They can also inspire us to live more meaningful lives. Studies suggest that seeing images of 
                heroes may move us to sense greater meaning in our lives—and even increase our drive to help others.</p>
            <p>Basic social cognitive theory tells us that we are motivated through “vicarious experiences”—as 
                we witness others’ actions. In fact, when adults observe courageous behaviors in their workplaces,
                 like a teacher standing up for a group of students or a colleague advocating for an important policy, 
                 they are more likely to see the potential for organizational change and feel inspired to act courageously 
                 themselves.</p>

            <p><b>5. Clarify your valuesg</b></p>
            <p>You may recognize heroism or courage in others, but sometimes struggle to see it in yourself. 
                If so, it may be helpful to ask yourself a few key questions:
             </p>
               <p>* What do I value in myself?</p>
                <p>* What do I “stand for”?</p>
               <p>* What is important to me?</p>
               <p> * What are some of my successes and accomplishments?</p>
            <p>When researchers measured teachers’ responses to prompts like these, they found that teachers’ 
                anxiety immediately decreased—and they experienced more positive emotions over time when compared
                 to a control group. Teachers’ values drive their goals and behaviors at school, while supporting
                  their well-being and a sense of self-efficacy at work. If we feel clear and capable, we may also
                   feel more courageous.

                Philosophers consider courage to be a foundational virtue because it guides us to act on behalf of 
                other virtues or values. In fact, our convictions, values, sense of integrity, honor, and loyalty can all 
                influence our courageous actions. When we experience a threat to our moral code, we are likely to act in 
                a way that upholds our beliefs and values. And the more powerful the belief, the more likely you will not 
                be influenced or swayed by those around you.</p>
